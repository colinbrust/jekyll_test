<u>A Message from the Director</u>

Please consider supporting your local Mesonet station. Accurate, localized weather and water data are essential—for protecting livelihoods, supporting agricultural decision-making, and predicting and preparing for extreme events such as drought, floods and fire.

In an effort to fill critical monitoring gaps in Montana’s rural areas we launched the Montana Mesonet in 2016 with $85,000 from the Montana Research and Economic Development Initiative and a handful of grass root partners and efforts. Since then, thanks to strong partnerships and over **$21 million in federal grants and contracts**, we have built the weather network to **170 stations**, with **79 more funded for construction by 2027**.

Officially part of the NOAA National Mesonet Program and the National Coordinated Soil Moisture Network, data from our network are being used by: 

- **The National Weather Service** for weather forecasts,
- **NOAA River Forecast Centers** for streamflow predictions,
- **The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers** for reservoir and flood management, and
- **The Governor’s Drought and Water Supply Advisory Committee** for drought monitoring. 

These data also directly support more accurate drought characterization by the U.S. Drought Monitor, which triggers federal disaster relief programs that have disbursed over **$1.12 billion in assistance to Montana agricultural producers since 2012.**

Beyond federal impact, we’re building tools based upon University Science to benefit Montana’s producers directly and improve on-farm cost savings. These include plant-available water calculators based upon soil property analysis, reference evapotranspiration, irrigation calculators, satellite estimates of productivity, cattle comfort indices, and growing degree day models tailored for Montana’s key crops.

**Unfortunately, federal funding in support of maintenance and operation of the Mesonet is uncertain, and the University-operated network currently receives no direct financial support from the state.**

Thank you for your consideration. Together, I hope we can preserve this critical infrastructure and continue building tools that serve Montana’s producers and communities.

# Support of Station Operations

An annual station sponsorship covers the costs of operations. This includes: data transmission fees, equipment upgrades, computing infrastructure, staffing, site travel and maintenance costs.

**Simply stated, the MCO will not profit from the stations or maintenance of the network beyond the inherent value in facilitating an expansive and publicly available soil moisture and climate information network for Montanans.**


## Exposure

The Montana Mesonet main webpage has over 60,000 views per year! Individual stations vary, the Scooby station receives ~150 hits per month. The users of the Montana Mesonet include all entities effected by drought, floods, climate events in their land-based livelihoods and require live data and advanced modeling to best adapt to current and future conditions. The users are your partners and customers.
